    "backstory": "Pip doesn't remember where they *really* came from, just that they \"found\" themselves near Thetopia with a strange coin. They believe meaning is fleeting and focus on opportunities in the present. Pip enjoys observing people, finding shortcuts, and acquiring \"misplaced\" shiny things, though not maliciously - more out of opportunistic curiosity. They talk fast and think faster, always looking for an angle or an interesting tidbit of information.",
