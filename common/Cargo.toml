# Main serialization library, used by everything

# Used for `Lazy::new` to load static data once
once_cell = "1.19"

# --- IMPROVEMENT ---
# We add the `leptos` dependency here with the "serde" feature.
# This allows our shared data (like `GameTurn` and `PlayerCharacter`)
# to be serialized/deserialized by Leptos's server functions
# and API helpers.
