# The Physics of Learning: Cognitive Load Framework

## Operationalizing Cognitive Science in "Ask Pete"

This document details the specific mapping between Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the "Train Yard" mechanics of Ask Pete. This framework serves as the "Physics Engine" for the instructional design process.

### 1. Intrinsic Load (The Weight of the Cargo)

**Definition:** Intrinsic load is the inherent difficulty of the specific subject matter. Teaching "Quantum Physics" has a higher intrinsic load than teaching "The Alphabet," regardless of how well it is taught. You cannot remove intrinsic load; you can only manage how much is lifted at once.

#### The Metaphor: The Train Cars & The Passengers

* **The Problem:** If a train tries to pull 500 tons of cargo with a small engine, it won't move. In education, if you give a student 100 new difficult concepts at once, they stall.

#### The Solution in Ask Pete

* **Chunking (The Vocabulary Cars):** The instructor uses the Train Yard to break the subject into smaller "Cars." A Node doesn't contain all the information; it contains one specific Train Car with a specific "Vocabulary Bank" (e.g., 10 words, not 50).
* **Load Check:** The system prevents the Train (Student) from leaving the Node if they haven't "lightened the load." The student acknowledges that they cannot attach a massive freight car of 50 complex terms. They must break it down.

### 2. Extraneous Load (The Condition of the Tracks)

**Definition:** Extraneous load is the mental effort wasted on understanding how the information is presented. If a textbook is poorly written, or a website has a confusing layout, the student burns mental energy just trying to find the lesson. This is "bad" load; we want to eliminate it.

#### The Metaphor: The Train Yard & The Map

* **The Problem:** Imagine a train driver who doesn't know where the next station is, or tracks that are rusty and twisted. The driver spends all their energy worrying about derailing rather than driving forward.

#### The Solution in Ask Pete

* **The Node Map:** By visualizing the curriculum as a "Map of Nodes" rather than a linear list, we reduce anxiety. The student can see exactly where they are (Point A) and where they are going (Point B).
* **The Tracks:** The Instructional Designer acts as the Logistician. By laying smooth "tracks" (logical connections) between the nodes in the Train Yard, they remove the confusion. The student doesn't have to guess "Why am I learning this?" The track shows the direct connection to the previous node.

### 3. Germane Load (The Engine Fuel & Combustion)

**Definition:** Germane load is the "good" effort. It is the mental energy devoted to actually processing information, constructing schemas, and storing knowledge in long-term memory. We want to maximize this.

#### The Metaphor: The Sandbox & The Quest

* **The Problem:** A train sitting at the station with cargo is useless. The engine needs to burn fuel to generate movement (Learning).

#### The Solution in Ask Pete

* **The Vocabulary Quest:** This is where the magic happens. To manage the "Intrinsic Load" (the heavy words in the car), the student enters the Sandbox.
* **Burning Coal:** The student isn't just staring at a flashcard (which is low effort). They are engaging in a Story/Quest. They have to explore the "Garden" of the node and use the vocabulary words in a sentence or narrative context to solve a problem. This consumes **Coal** (Compute Tokens).
* **Generating Steam:** By using the words in a story (GameLit), the student effectively "burns the Coal" (Germane Load) to generate **Steam**. This process effectively "lightens" the cargo. Once they have used the words in context, the heavy "Unknown Vocabulary" transforms into lighter "Mastered Knowledge," allowing the engine to pull the car to the next node.

### Summary for the Instructional Designer

When using the Ask Pete Authoring Tool, the Instructor's job is to be the **Yard Master**:

1. **Manage Intrinsic Load:** Don't build Train Cars that are too heavy. Put fewer "Passengers" (Vocabulary words) in each car.
2. **Minimize Extraneous Load:** Build clear, logical Tracks between Nodes so the student never feels lost on the Map.
3. **Maximize Germane Load:** Create engaging Sandbox Quests that force the student to burn fuel (mental effort) by using the vocabulary in a story context.
