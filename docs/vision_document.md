# Vision Document: Ask Pete & The Train Yard

## A Purdue Capstone Proposal for the Future of Instructional Design

### I. The Philosophy: Bridging the Digital Divide

In the current landscape of education, a widening chasm exists between the "Digital Native" software engineers building the tools and the "Pedagogical Traditionalists" who possess the wisdom of teaching but lack the digital fluency to utilize complex software.

**Ask Pete is the bridge.**

It is not merely an application; it is a translation layer. It translates the rigid logic of computer code into the fluid, organic logic of human learning. It allows the Instructional Designer (ID) to stop worrying about file structures and databases and start thinking like a "Logistician of the Mind."

By utilizing **Pete**—an AI Persona specifically trained in the arts of pedagogy and structural frameworking—we empower the teacher to construct complex, non-linear learning environments without writing a single line of code. We are not replacing the teacher; we are giving the teacher a Conductor and a construction crew.

### II. The Core Metaphor: The Train Yard & The Journey

To standardize the complex psychological concept of "Cognitive Load" and "Curriculum Mapping," Ask Pete utilizes a unifying allegory: **The Train**.

#### 1. The Train (The Student)

The Student is the Train. Their purpose is movement—progression from ignorance to understanding. However, a train is a heavy machine. It has momentum, it requires fuel, and crucially, it has a limit on how much it can pull.

* **The Engine:** The student’s will and intellectual capacity.
* **The Passengers:** The knowledge, ideas, and experiences the student must acquire.
* **The Fuel (Coal):** The student’s mental energy and compute tokens. Coal is scarce.

#### 2. The Train Yard (The Authoring Tool)

The "Train Yard" is the user interface for the Instructional Designer. Here, the ID acts as the Logistician. They do not drive the train; they build the environment in which the train operates. In the Train Yard, the ID lays down the tracks. Unlike a book, which is linear, a mind is a network. Therefore, the ID creates a **Map of Nodes**.

* **The Tracks:** The logical connections between concepts.
* **The Switches:** Decision points where a student can change perspective or direction.
* **The Schedule:** The pacing of the course, ensuring the train doesn't derail from going too fast.

#### 3. The Sandbox (The Node)

When the train arrives at a Node (a lesson topic), the movement stops. The student "gets off the train." This is the **Sandbox**. The Sandbox is a GameLit RPG environment. It is a psychological map of that specific subject. Here, the abstraction of "learning" becomes the reality of "exploration."

* **The Garden:** Within the sandbox, knowledge is treated like a garden. It requires tending. Ideas (plants) grow in complexity. The student must nurture these ideas to harvest the fruit (mastery).
* **The Hero’s Journey:** The AI (Pete) analyzes the subject matter and automatically generates a "Call to Adventure," "Guardians of the Threshold," and "Social Conflict" relevant to that topic. The student isn't just memorizing definitions; they are the protagonist in a story about that concept.

### III. The Physics of Learning: Cognitive Load Mechanics

The crowning feature of Ask Pete is how it visualizes **Cognitive Load Theory** for the instructor.

In traditional teaching, we often overload students, causing "derailment." In the Train Yard, this is visualized physically:

1. **Intrinsic Load (The Cargo Weight):** The difficulty of the specific topic.
2. **Extraneous Load (The Track Conditions):** How confusing the instruction is. If the tracks are rusty or the map is bad, the train slows down.
3. **Germane Load (The Engine Power):** The energy dedicated to actually processing information (making schemas).

#### The Mechanic

The Instructional Designer attaches **Train Cars** to the student's engine.

* **The Vocabulary Quest:** Each Node offers a "Train Car" containing a vocabulary bank (e.g., 50 words).
* **Capacity Check:** The train cannot leave the station if the load is too heavy. The student cannot "attach" the car until they have reduced the weight of the ignorance.
* **The Unloading Process:** To "earn" the car, the student enters the Sandbox. They must engage in a narrative story where they encounter these words. They must use the words in context—storified language—to prove they understand. This burns **Coal** and generates **Steam** (Mastery). Only once enough Steam is generated can the car be attached, and the train proceed to the next node.

### IV. The Role of Pete (The AI Teacher for Teachers)

Pete is not a generic chatbot. **Pete is the Station Master.**

* **For the "Dinosaur":** If an instructor knows what they want to teach but doesn't know how to build a non-linear node graph, they just talk to Pete. *"Pete, I want to teach 19th-century history focusing on industrialization."*
* **The Construction:** Pete systematically breaks this subject down. He suggests the Nodes. He drafts the Tracks. He suggests the "Social Roles" for the Hero's Journey in the sandbox.
* **The Acceptance:** The Instructor simply reviews the map Pete has drawn in the Train Yard and says, *"Yes, that looks like a safe route."*

### V. Project Scope & Capstone Goals

This project demonstrates a mastery of full-stack engineering, AI integration, and educational psychology.

* **Technical Excellence:** Utilization of Rust and Tauri for high-performance, local-first computing (The Train Engine).
* **AI Orchestration:** Using Large Language Models (LLMs) not just to generate text, but to generate structure (The Map and Social Roles).
* **User Experience:** A "Train Yard" UI that makes complex graph-theory accessible to non-technical users.
* **Pedagogical Impact:** A system that forces adherence to Cognitive Load Theory, ensuring that the "Train" (Student) is never given more "Passengers" (Data) than they can safely transport.

Ask Pete transforms the abstract difficulty of teaching into a tangible, navigable, and manageable journey. It turns the curriculum into a map, the student into a traveler, and the teacher into the architect of the world.
