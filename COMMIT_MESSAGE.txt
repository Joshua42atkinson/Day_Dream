chore: fix compilation warnings and clean up code

- Fixed dead_code warning for ActivePanel::None variant in dispatcher_console.rs
- Fixed unused import warning for once_cell::sync::Lazy in common/src/lib.rs
- Moved Lazy import to cfg(feature = "ssr") block where it's actually used
- Both backend and frontend now compile cleanly with only minor deprecation warnings
